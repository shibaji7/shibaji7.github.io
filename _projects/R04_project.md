#### [CHIPS](https://pychips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Coronal Hole Identification using Probabilistic Scheme.
pyCHIPS is an open source Python-based model to identify Coronal Holes (CH) and associated boundaries in solar images. The model is used to estimate the probabilities of the Coronal Holes identified by the scheme.

#### Unveiling the Magnetic Mysteries of the Solar Corona: The CHIPS Perspective
The enigmatic dance of magnetic fields on the surface of the sun has long captivated solar physicists. To unravel the intricacies of these magnetic phenomena, a focused approach is imperative. I propose a paradigm shift in our overarching objectiveâ€”a shift that directs our attention toward a meticulous comparison between observed and modeled coronal holes, with the aim of refining magnetic models.

At the heart of this transformative approach lies the indispensable role of **CHIPS**. This innovative algorithm, designed to delineate coronal holes, is not merely a tool for identification but a key player in estimating uncertainties. In the realm of magnetic modeling, where precision is paramount, these uncertainties become invaluable.

Why the emphasis on uncertainties? The answer lies in the dynamic nature of the sun. Coronal holes, those enigmatic windows into the sun's magnetic soul, exhibit variations that are challenging to model accurately. **CHIPS** not only identifies these features but quantifies the certainty of its detections. This quantification becomes the linchpin in refining our magnetic models.

As we embark on this journey of comparison, let us leverage the power of **CHIPS** to bring clarity to the shadows of our solar understanding. By incorporating uncertainties into our models, we equip ourselves with the tools needed to navigate the intricate magnetic landscape of the sun. Join me in advocating for a future where observed and modeled coronal holes converge, pushing the boundaries of our understanding and paving the way for more accurate magnetic models.
