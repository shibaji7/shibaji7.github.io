  ABSTRACT={Submarine cables have become a vital component of modern infrastructure, but past submarine cable natural hazard studies have mostly focused on potential cable damage from landslides and tsunamis. A handful of studies examine the possibility of space weather effects in submarine cables. The main purpose of this study is to develop a computational model, using Python, of geomagnetic induction on submarine cables. The model is used to estimate the induced voltage in the submarine cables in response to geomagnetic disturbances. It also utilizes newly acquired knowledge from magnetotelluric studies and associated investigations of geomagnetically induced currents in power systems. We describe the Python-based software, its working principle, inputs/outputs based on synthetic geomagnetic field data, and compare its operational capabilities against analytical solutions. We present the results for different model inputs, and find: 1) the seawater layer acts as a shield in the induction process: the greater the ocean depth, the smaller the seafloor geoelectric field; and 2) the model is sensitive to the Ocean-Earth layered conductivity structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sudden enhancement in high-frequency absorption is a well-known impact of solar flare-driven Short-Wave Fadeout (SWF). Less understood, is a perturbation of the radio wave frequency as it traverses the ionosphere in the early stages of SWF, also known as the Doppler flash. Investigations have suggested two possible sources that might contribute to it’s manifestation: first, enhancements of plasma density in the D-and lower E-regions; second, the lowering of the F-region reflection point. Our recent work investigated a solar flare event using first principles modeling and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radar observations and found that change in the F-region refractive index is the primary driver of the Doppler flash. This study analyzes multiple solar flare events observed across different SuperDARN HF radars to determine how flare characteristics, properties of the traveling radio wave, and geophysical conditions impact the Doppler flash. In addition, we use incoherent scatter radar data and first-principles modeling to investigate physical mechanisms that drive the lowering of the F-region reflection points. We found, (a) on average, the change in E- and F-region refractive index is the primary driver of the Doppler flash, (b) solar zenith angle, ray’s elevation angle, operating frequency, and location of the solar flare on the solar disk can alter the ionospheric regions of maximum contribution to the Doppler flash, (c) increased ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductance causes a reduction of the daytime eastward electric field, and consequently reduces the vertical ion-drift in the lower and middle latitude ionosphere, which results in lowering of the F-region ray reflection point.},

  abstract = {Abstract Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF: 3–30 MHz) signals experience strong attenuation following a solar flare-driven sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID). Solar flare-driven HF absorption, referred to as short-wave fadeout, is a well-known impact of SIDs, but the initial Doppler frequency shift phenomena, also known as “Doppler flash” in the traveling radio wave is not well understood. This study seeks to advance our understanding of the initial impacts of solar flare-driven SID using a physics-based whole atmosphere model for a specific solar flare event. First, we demonstrate that the Doppler flash phenomenon observed by Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars can be successfully reproduced using first-principles based modeling. The output from the simulation is validated against SuperDARN line-of-sight Doppler velocity measurements. We then examine which region of the ionosphere, D, E, or F, makes the largest contribution to the Doppler flash. We also consider the relative contribution of change in refractive index through the ionospheric layers versus lowered reflection height. We find: (a) the model is able to reproduce radar observations with an root-median-squared-error and a mean percentage error (δ) of 3.72 m/s and 0.67\%, respectively; (b) the F-region is the most significant contributor to the total Doppler flash (∼48\%), 30\% of which is contributed by the change in F-region's refractive index, while the other ∼18\% is due to change in ray reflection height. Our analysis shows lowering of the F-region's ray reflection point is a secondary driver compared to the change in refractive index.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over-the-Horizon communication is strongly dependent on the state of the ionosphere, which is susceptible to solar flares. Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) signals can experience strong attenuation following a solar flare that lasts typically for an hour, commonly referred to as shortwave fadeout (SWF). In this study, we examine the role of dispersion relation and collision frequency formulations on the estimation of SWF in riometer observations using a new physics-based model framework. The new framework first uses modified solar irradiance models incorporating high-resolution solar flux data from the GOES satellite X-ray sensors as input to compute the enhanced ionization produced during a flare event. The framework then uses different dispersion relation and collision frequency formulations to estimate the enhanced HF absorption. The modeled HF absorption is compared with riometer data to determine which formulation best reproduces the observations. We find the Appleton-Hartree dispersion relation in combination with the averaged collision frequency profile reproduces riometer observations with an average skill score of 0.4, representing 40\% better forecast ability than the existing D-region Absorption Prediction model. Our modeling results also indicate that electron temperature plays an important role in controlling HF absorption. We suggest that adoption of the Appleton-Hartree dispersion relation in combination with the averaged collision frequency be considered for improved forecasting of ionospheric absorption following solar flares.},

  abstract = {Abstract The term “sluggishness” was coined by E. V. Appleton in the 1950s to describe the time delay between peak irradiance at solar noon and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density. Sluggishness can be understood as an inertial property of the ionosphere that manifests as a lag of the ionospheric response to a solar driver. As shown by Appleton, estimates of sluggishness can be used to study the chemistry of the lower ionosphere, of the D-region in particular. In this study, for the first time, we have examined ionospheric sluggishness in terms of the time delay between the peak irradiance during a solar flare and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density using HF instruments. Estimates of the delay are obtained using HF observations from riometers and SuperDARN radars that are primarily sensitive to absorption in the D-region. Two new methods for measuring delay are introduced. Sluggishness is shown to be anti-correlated with peak solar X-ray flux and positively correlated with zenith angle and latitude. The choices of instrument, method, and reference solar waveband affect the sluggishness estimation. A simulation study was performed to estimate the effective recombination coefficient in the D-region. The coefficient was found to vary by orders of magnitude with peak flare intensity. We argue that the variation in effective recombination coefficient with peak flare intensity is highly sensitive to changes in the negative and positive ion chemistry of the D-region, which is sensitive to the incoming solar X-ray and EUV radiation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Sun was remarkably active during the first week of September 2017 producing numerous solar flares, solar radiation storms, and coronal mass ejections. This activity caused disruption to terrestrial high-frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) radio communication channels including observations with the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radars. In this paper, we analyze the response of SuperDARN groundscatter observations and decreases in background sky noise level in response to multiple solar flares occurring in quick succession and co-occurring with solar energetic protons and auroral activity. We estimate the attenuation in HF signal strength using an approach similar to riometry and find that the radars exhibit a nonlinear response to compound solar flare events. Additionally, we find that the three different space weather drivers have varying degrees of influence on the HF signal properties at different latitudes. Our study demonstrates that in addition to monitoring high-latitude convection, SuperDARN observations can be used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of disruption to HF communication during extreme space weather conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Short-wave fadeout (SWF) is a well-known radio wave anomaly which follows Earth-directed solar flares and leads to severe disruption of transionospheric high-frequency systems. The disruption is produced by flare-enhanced soft and hard X-rays that penetrate to the D layer where they dramatically enhance ionization leading to heavy high-frequency absorption over much of the dayside for an hour or more. In this paper, we describe how Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations can be exploited to analyze SWF events. Superposed epoch analysis of multiple signatures reveals the typical characteristics of SWF. The number of SuperDARN ground scatter echoes drops suddenly (≈100 s) and sharply after a solar flare, reaching a maximum depth of suppression within a few tens of minutes, and then recovering to pre-SWF conditions over half an hour or so. The depth of echo suppression depends on the solar zenith angle, radio wave frequency, and intensity of the flare. Furthermore, ground scatter echoes typically exhibit a sudden phase change leading to a dramatic increase in apparent Doppler velocity (the so-called “Doppler flash”), which statistically precedes the dropout in ground scatter echoes. We report here on the characterization of SWF effects in SuperDARN ground scatter observations produced by several X class solar flares. We also describe the functional dependence of peak Doppler flash on solar zenith angle, frequency, and peak intensity of solar flux.},

The geomagnetic storm on 21–22 January 2005 is considered to be anomalous as the SYM-H index that signifies the strength of ring current, decreases and had a sustained trough value of −101 nT lasting more than 6 hr under northward IMF Bz conditions. In this work, the standard WINDMI model is utilized to estimate the growth and decay of magnetospheric currents by using several solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions. However, it is found that the WINDMI model driven by any of these coupling functions is not fully able to explain the decrease of SYM-H under northward IMF Bz. A dense plasma sheet along with signatures of a highly stretched magnetosphere was observed during this storm. The SYM-H variations during the entire duration of the storm were only reproduced after modifying the WINDMI model to account for the effects of the dense plasma sheet. The limitations of directly driven models relying purely on the solar wind parameters and not accounting for the state of the magnetosphere are highlighted by this work.},

  abstract = {Abstract Interplanetary (IP) shock-driven sudden compression of the Earth's magnetosphere produces electromagnetic disturbances in the polar ionosphere. Several studies have examined the effects of IP shock on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling systems using all-sky cameras and radars. In this study, we examine responses and drivers of the polar ionosphere following an IP shock compression on 16 June 2012. We observe the vertical drift and concurrent horizontal motion of the plasma. Observations from digisonde located at Antarctic Zhongshan station (ZHO) showed an ionospheric thick E region ionization and associated vertical downward plasma motion at F region. In addition, horizontal ionospheric convection reversals were observed on the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network ZHO and McMurdo radar observations. Findings suggest that the transient convective reversal breaks the original shear equilibrium, it is expected that the IP shock-induced electric field triggers an enhanced velocity shear mapping to the E region. The horizontal motion of the plasma was attributed to only the dusk-to-dawn electric field that existed during the preliminary phase of sudden impulse. We also found that ionospheric convection reversals were driven by a downward field-aligned current. The results of these observations reveal, for the first time, the immediate and direct cusp ionosphere response to the IP shock, which is critical for understanding the global response of the magnetosphere following an abrupt change in Interplanetory Magnetic Field (IMF) and solar wind conditions.},

  abstract={Ionospheric variability produces measurable effects in Doppler shift of HF (high-frequency, 3–30 MHz) skywave signals. These effects are straightforward to measure with low-cost equipment and are conducive to citizen science campaigns. The low-cost Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) network is a modular network of community-maintained, open-source receivers, which measure Doppler shift in the precise carrier signals of time standard stations. The primary goal of this paper is to explain the types of measurements this instrument can make and some of its use cases, demonstrating its role as the building block for a large-scale ionospheric and HF propagation measurement network which complements existing professional networks. Here, data from the PSWS network are presented for a period of time spanning late 2019 to early 2022. Software tools for the visualization and analysis of this living dataset are also discussed and provided. These tools are robust to data interruptions and to the addition, removal or modification of stations, allowing both short- and long-term visualization at higher density and faster cadence than other methods. These data may be used to supplement observations made with other geospace instruments in event-based analyses, e.g., traveling ionospheric disturbances and solar flares, and to assess the accuracy of the bottomside estimates of ionospheric models by comparing the oblique paths obtained by ionospheric ray tracers with those obtained by these receivers. The data are archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6622111 (Collins, 2022).},

The Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars (RISR-C and RISR-N), measuring plasma parameters in the cusp and polar cap, observed ionospheric signatures of flux transfer events (FTEs) that resulted in the formation of polar cap patches. The patches were observed as they moved over the RISR, and the Canadian High-Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) ionosondes and GPS receivers. The coupling process modulated the ionospheric convection and the intensity of ionospheric currents, including the auroral electrojets. The horizontal equivalent ionospheric currents (EICs) are estimated from ground-based magnetometer data using an inversion technique. Pulses of ionospheric currents that are a source of Joule heating in the lower thermosphere launched atmospheric gravity waves, causing traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) that propagated equatorward. The TIDs were observed in the SuperDual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) high-frequency (HF) radar ground scatter and the detrended total electron content (TEC) measured by globally distributed Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers.},

  abstract = {Electron density enhancement caused by electromagnetic radiation emitted during a solar X-ray flare has the potential to increase high frequency (HF; 3–30 MHz) absorption in the dayside D-region ionosphere, impacting shortwave radio signals by reducing the signal strength, a phenomenon commonly referred to as shortwave fadeout. Data-based optimization of a simple absorption model is performed incorporating solar X-ray flux data and 30 MHz riometer data from stations distributed across Canada. In a single event study the data-based optimization model is shown to overestimate absorption by 1% for the duration of an X2.1 solar X-ray flare. This corrects an underestimation by the NOAA D-region Absorption Prediction (D-RAP) model. In a statistical study, based on 87 events, data-based optimization performed on an event-by-event basis showed excellent overall agreement between measured and modelled data: the Pearson correlation coefficient was R = 0.88, and the slope of the best-fit line to the data was m = 0.91. A generalized model was developed using data from all 87 events collectively. Although good agreement was found between the measured and modelled data sets, correlation and slope were slightly reduced to R = 0.75 and m = 0.80. Model accuracy is characterized by prediction efficiency (PE) which peaked at PE = 0.78 for the event-by-event evaluation and PE = 0.48 for the collective data set. The results of this study highlight the advantages of data-based optimization in modelling absorption due to shortwave fadeout.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ionospheric conductance is a crucial factor in regulating the closure of magnetospheric field-aligned currents through the ionosphere as Hall and Pedersen currents. Despite its importance in predictive investigations of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, the estimation of ionospheric conductance in the auroral region is precarious in most global first-principles-based models. This impreciseness in estimating the auroral conductance impedes both our understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system during extreme space weather events. In this article, we address this concern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme Events (CMEE) that estimates the auroral conductance from field-aligned current values. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth of 1-min resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including times of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The model also includes provisions to enhance the conductance in the aurora using additional adjustments to refine the auroral oval. CMEE has been incorporated within the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) for usage in space weather simulations. This paper compares performance of CMEE against the existing conductance model in RIM, through a validation process for six space weather events. The performance analysis indicates overall improvement in the ionospheric feedback to ground-based space weather forecasts. Specifically, the model is able to improve the prediction of ionospheric currents, which impact the simulated dB/dt and ΔB, resulting in substantial improvements in dB/dt predictive skill.},

  abstract = {Abstract Increased electron density in the ionosphere due to photoionization by radiation emitted during a solar X-ray flare impacts high-frequency (HF) radio wave propagation. Shortwave fadeout (SWF) due to the enhanced D region absorption that results is characterized by the level of cosmic radio noise attenuation derived from riometer measurements. SWF impacts HF radio propagation and has been identified in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) data. An X2.1 solar X-ray flare that erupted on 11 March 2015 is examined to determine its effects on HF radio propagation. Riometer data indicate a sharp enhancement in absorption, which falls off with increasing solar zenith angle. SuperDARN radars observed a suppression of both ground scatter and ionospheric echoes. Ground scatter data indicated a rapid weakening of signal from far to near ranges followed by a ~20-min interval of complete signal loss. Recovery lasted ~30 min and proceeded from near to far ranges. Prior to the complete signal loss, an apparent sharp velocity impulse (Doppler flash) lasting 1–2 min was observed in the ground scatter data. The peak of this flash preceded the onset of enhanced absorption. The onset of signal loss by SuperDARN preceded the onset of enhanced absorption observed by riometers. Both data sets observed a positive correlation between increasing delay in onset and increasing solar zenith angle with onset progressing at an average rate of 16.7°/min (0.060 min/°). Agreement between riometer and SuperDARN indicates the possibility of using a joint data set for improved monitoring of the space weather impact of solar X-ray flares.},

  abstract={Short-wave fadeout (SWF) is one of the first space weather effects to occur in the ionosphere following a solar flare and leads to severe disruption of ionospheric HF systems. The disruption is produced by flare-enhanced energetic radiations that penetrate to the D-layer where they enhance ionization that leads to heavy absorption of high-frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) radio signal over much of the dayside for an hour or more. In this paper, we describe two probabilistic anomaly detection schemes that have been used to detect SWF events produced by M and X class flares in Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations. The two schemes are based on statistical Z-score and nonlinear energy operators. Performance of the detection schemes varies with flare intensity and parameters of the detection schemes. We find a correlation coefficient ~0.73 between flare counts per month and SWF counts per month detected using the Z-score scheme.},

abstract = {Abstract Submarine cables have experienced problems during extreme geomagnetic disturbances because of geomagnetically induced voltages adding or subtracting from the power feed to the repeaters. This is still a concern for modern fiber-optic cables because they contain a copper conductor to carry power to the repeaters. This paper provides a new examination of geomagnetic induction in submarine cables and makes calculations of the voltages experienced by the TAT-8 trans-Atlantic submarine cable during the March 1989 magnetic storm. It is shown that the cable itself experiences an induced electromotive force (emf) and that induction in the ocean also leads to changes of potential of the land at each end of the cable. The process for calculating the electric fields induced in the sea and in the cable from knowledge of the seawater depth and conductivity and subsea conductivity is explained. The cable route is divided into 9 sections and the seafloor electric field is calculated for each section. These are combined to give the total induced emf in the cable. In addition, induction in the seawater and leakage of induced currents through the underlying resistive layers are modeled using a transmission line model of the ocean and underlying layers to determine the change in Earth potentials at the cable ends. The induced emf in the cable and the end potentials are then combined to give the total voltage change experienced by the cable power feed equipment. This gives results very close to those recorded on the TAT-8 cable in March 1989.},

abstract = {Abstract The mid-latitude ionospheric trough (MLIT), an anomaly in the ionosphere's F layer caused by various mechanisms, affects radio wave propagation. In this study, we investigated the morphology and oscillations of the MLIT using global Global Positioning System total electron content map data between 1 January 2018, and 31 December 2020. The MLIT position varies longitudinally, reaching its farthest equatorward at 60° \${}^{\circ}\$W and its farthest poleward at 30° \${}^{\circ}\$E. The MLIT occurrence rates peak during the winter and equinoxes and dip in summer, while seasonal variations in MLIT position vary across longitude bands. Heightened geomagnetic activities, quantified by the SME6 index, promote MLIT occurrence, especially during pre-midnight hours in summer and equinoxes, and shift the MLIT equatorward, particularly during midnight and post-midnight hours. The MLIT position shows clear local time variation, with a gradual decrease before midnight, stabilization afterward, and a minor resurgence around dawn. Wavelet analysis reveals three distinct periodic components in the MLIT position: 27, 13.5, and 9, with the 27-day period being the most persistent. Cross-wavelet and wavelet coherence analyses suggest that solar wind (SW) velocity variations precede changes in the MLIT position. The main factors responsible for the equatorward movement of MLIT are the electric fields in high-speed SW that enhance the ionospheric convection pattern, and the intensified geomagnetic activities induced by interplanetary shocks.},

abstract = {Abstract This study uses multiple ground and satellite-based measurements to investigate the extreme ionospheric response to the Mother's Day storm on May 10–11, 2024. Prompt penetration electric field caused a significant enhancement in the ionospheric vertical drift (∼ \${\sim} \$ 95 m/s) and the equatorial electrojet strength (∼ \${\sim} \$ 275 nT) over Jicamarca. These extreme eastward electric field perturbations, along with the large meridional wind, significantly altered the F-region plasma fountain at different local times. The afternoon equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) not only sustained for an exceptionally long duration (∼ \${\sim} \$ 12 hr) but also expanded spatially over time. The separation between the two peaks of EIA crests exceeded ∼48° \${\sim} 48{}^{\circ}\$ and ∼70° \${\sim} 70{}^{\circ}\$ in the morning and evening sectors, respectively. This study shows, for the first time, that unusually strong EIA can not only develop at different local times but can also sustain for long duration under favorable conditions, which has implications for space weather applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Ultra low frequency (ULF; 1 mHz - several Hz) waves are key to energy transport within the geospace system, yet their contribution to Joule heating in the upper atmosphere remains poorly quantified. This study statistically examines Joule heating associated with ionospheric ULF perturbations using Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) data spanning middle to polar latitudes. Our analysis utilizes high-time-resolution measurements from SuperDARN high-frequency coherent scatter radars operating in a special mode, sampling three “camping beams” approximately every 18 s. We focus on ULF perturbations within the Pc5 frequency range (1.6–6.7 mHz), estimating Joule heating rates from ionospheric electric fields derived from SuperDARN data and height-integrated Pedersen conductance from empirical models. The analysis includes statistical characterization of Pc5 wave occurrence, electric fields, Joule heating rates, and azimuthal wave numbers. Our results reveal enhanced electric fields and Joule heating rates in the morning and pre-midnight sectors, even though Pc5 wave occurrences peak in the afternoon. Joule heating is more pronounced in the high-latitude morning sector during northward interplanetary magnetic field conditions, attributed to local time asymmetry in Pedersen conductance and Pc5 waves driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Pc5 waves observed by multiple camping beams predominantly propagate westward at low azimuthal wave numbers (|m|<50) \$(\vert m\vert < 50)\$, while high-m waves propagate mainly eastward. Although Joule heating estimates may be underestimated due to assumptions about empirical conductance models and the underestimation of electric fields resulting from SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity measurements, these findings offer valuable insights into ULF wave-related energy dissipation in the geospace system.},

abstract={The ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) is a convergence point of energy and processes that interconnect Earth's atmosphere with space. Processes generated by terrestrial weather in the lower atmosphere (i.e., troposphere and stratosphere, altitudes less than{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}50 km) are recognized by the scientific community as sources of variability in both the structure and composition of the IT. Exposed to persistent wave forcing from terrestrial weather sources and solar and magnetic forcing, the IT is a domain of compelling scientific inquiry that connects thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and plasma physics. Predicting its space weather is of significant national interest for space situation awareness including the very low earth orbit as the new frontier of space operations. Advancing the understanding of whole atmosphere interconnections between terrestrial and space weather requires coordinated modeling and observational efforts across different spatial and temporal scales. Toward this goal, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), through the living with a star (LWS) program, established in 2022 a focused science topic (FST) to study the problem from various angles. In this manuscript we report on the vision, goals and status of the ongoing FST ``Impact of Terrestrial Weather on the Ionosphere---Thermosphere''. Initial results show bigger impacts on the IT than hitherto thought and help to more clearly define the state-of-the-art in the context of future NASA missions such as EZIE, DYNAMIC and GDC.},

abstract = {Abstract A total solar eclipse (TSE) traversed the continental US (CONUS) from west to east on 21 August 2017. Ionosondes located under the eclipse totality at Lusk (Wyoming) and Boulder (Colorado) observed the ionospheric G-condition 20 min after totality. The Millstone Hill mid-latitude incoherent scatter radar recorded an anomalous low altitude F2 peak during the recovery phase of the eclipse, which can be attributed to an ionospheric G-condition. We perform WACCM-X simulations to investigate the physical processes that drive the ionospheric G-condition. Specifically, we conducted a diagnostic analysis of the simulated atomic oxygen ion continuity equation to examine the source of the G-condition. We defined two metrics describing the G-condition: (a) the duration and (b) the maximum difference between \${\mathrm{N}}\_{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{F}}\_{1}\$ and \${\mathrm{N}}\_{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{F}}\_{2}\$. Results indicate that E- and F1 plasma density reduction closely follow the eclipse obscuration, whereas the F2-layer density depletion lags the obscuration by \${\sim} \$20 min. This delay increases with altitude and is caused by slower radiative recombination and transport processes in the diffusion-dominated F2-region. The delay creates a period during the eclipse recovery when the F1-plasma density exceeds that of the F2-peak, which manifests as the ionospheric G-condition. The simulation study illuminates the space-time behavior of the G-condition indicating that this state can last for more than 50 min during the recovery phase of the eclipse.},

abstract = {Abstract Total electron content (TEC) measurements recorded by a dense network of ground receivers tracking signals from Global Navigation Satellite System satellites provide a large number of data points and are one of the most effective methods for observing the horizontal characteristics of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). Conventionally, the receiver-satellite line-of-sight (LOS) geometry of TEC measurements is not considered except for applying an elevation cut-off angle to exclude measurements of high signal noise. However, as TEC is the total number of electrons spatially integrated along its LOS, its effectiveness in observing TIDs is heavily influenced by the LOS alignment with respect to the electron density perturbations. LOSs that pass through regions of both increased and decreased electron densities are ineffective at detecting the perturbations from ambient waves. This is because the opposite phases are canceled, yielding a TEC measurement that is not sensitive to the wave characteristic. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of different LOS azimuth orientations for TEC observations of concentric TIDs induced by gravity waves (GWs) generated by a tropospheric convective source over the Continental United States (CONUS). Results indicate that the observation and characterization of TIDs from GWs can be significantly improved by using only LOSs with certain azimuth angles.},
