Dr. Shibaji Chakraborty is a `Research Scientist` at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University ([ERAU](https://sail.erau.edu/)), currently working in [SAIL](https://sites.erau.edu/sail/) under the supervision of [Dr. Aroh Barjatya](https://faculty.erau.edu/Aroh.Barjatya). His research primarily revolves around the study of transient space weather impact on the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (MIT) systems and aims to provide a probabilistic now-cast of space weather conditions specifically during extreme events. Dr. Chakraborty employs various tools and software in his research, including Python, MATLAB, and anything open-source (primarily revolves around Python).

[Chakraborty](https://shibaji7.github.io/) worked as a `Postdoctoral Associate` at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) from `May 2021` till `September 2024`, specializing in Space Weather research. With a focus on the impacts of Space Weather on HF propagation using SuperDARN, [Chakraborty](https://shibaji7.github.io/) has accumulated years of experience in the [SuperDARN Group](https://vt.superdarn.org/), working under the supervision of Dr. Joseph [Baker](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/baker.html) and Dr. J. Michael [Ruohoniemi](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/ruohoniemi.html).

Before his tenure in Space Weather research, Dr. Chakraborty served as an `Information Technology Analyst` at [Tata Consultancy Services Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) from `September 2010 to July 2015`. During this period, [Chakraborty](https://shibaji7.github.io/) gained `4.75` years of valuable experience working on diverse projects, including the Home Energy Management System and Device Management System. His role involved handling different software development modules like API and APP gateway, automated user application deployment module, distributed task queue, and Sensor data explorer (Cloud-based). [Chakraborty](https://shibaji7.github.io/) utilized a wide range of tools and software, such as Python, Java, C, JavaScript, Lua, HTML, XML, JSON, CSS, Scala, Akka (Parallel computational Framework), Redis, and MySQL.
